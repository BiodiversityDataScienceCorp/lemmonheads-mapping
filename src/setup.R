# NOPE archive is too big (> 100 MB) for GitHub. But there might be a solution
# GitHub large file storage https://git-lfs.github.com/
# Better yet, just make a few (4?) smaller archives

# Downloading of forecast data deprecated to avoid dependency on troublesome 
# rgdal. Instead use 
#   `forecast.data <- raster::stack(x = "data/cmip5/2_5m/forecast-raster.gri")`
# when forecast data are needed
# Download forecast data
# See https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-014-2418-8
# for recommendations of the model to use
# forecast.data <- getData(name = "CMIP5", # forecast
#                          var = "bio", # bioclim
#                          res = 2.5,
#                          path = "data/",
#                          model = "GD", # GFDL-ESM2G
#                          rcp = "45", # CO2 increase 4.5
#                          year = 70) # 2070
# For those interested, the workaround was:
#  1. With rgdal installed, use the getData code as above
#  2. With the `bioclim.data` object in memory, run 
#      `names(forecast.data) <- names(bioclim.data)`
#  3. Save the file as a raster using `raster::writeRaster` with default 
#      format (.gri)
#  4. Compress the resultant .gri and .grd files via
#     `zip(zipfile = "data/cmip5/2_5m/forecast-data.zip", 
#          files = c("data/cmip5/2_5m/forcast-raster.grd", 
#                    "data/cmip5/2_5m/forcast-raster.gri"))`
#  6. Include that zip archive under version control, but not the .gri and .grd
#      files
#  5. Update this file (scripts/setup.R) to unzip the archive, inflating the 
#      .grd and .gri files (directory structure was preserved by `zip` command)

# Clean up workspace
rm(required, successful, unsuccessful, bioclim.data, forecast.archives, forecast.data)
